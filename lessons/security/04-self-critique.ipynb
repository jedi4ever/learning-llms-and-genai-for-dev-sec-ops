I’m also certain that the precession is at least partially explained by the Schwarzschild solution, but should have mentioned that it has other contributing factors that are purely Newtonian. Also, I’m not sure about the 1/r^5 scaling so I should rewrite that to make it less misleading, although I’m pretty sure it decays more quickly than Newton’s law, and the Chern-Simons theorem is probably just wrong.
